# zoom
The Zoom engine. A simple yet powerful game engine designed to teach kids how to program computers.

Zoom is a simple game engine inspired in the hobby 8-bit computers of the early days (my personal experience comes from programming a MSX 1.1). Zoom runs on Python and allows a very tight loop feedback between writing code and seeing the results on the screen. Zoom's API is small and easy to learn and use, still, it is powerful enough to render intricate 2D games. The runtime works within Python's interactive prompt. It has five subsytesms: screen, resources, audio, input, collision.
